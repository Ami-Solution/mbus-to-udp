# MBUS to UDP converter

## System decription
The converter consists of a interface card mounted on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Input is a stream of meter data on a MBUS interface. Output is a stream of JSON objects sent to a UDP port on a extern server running Node Red. Network connection is via RPi's internal wifi card. 
The converter card is supplied from the MBUS line, Raspbery Pi is sypplied from a separate 5V power supply.
RPi and converter card is connected via three pins in the GPIO header - 3,3V, UART RX and GND.

## The converter card
A MBUS interface IC NCN5150 needs a small number of external components to function. Connection to the smart meter is via standard ethernet cable (MBUS uses pins 1 and 2) through a RJ45 socket. The converter card has the same header pins as the Raspberry Pi. It is possible to connect all the 40 pins, but it is not required. Only three pins must be connected.

## Data stream from smart meter
This description is for Kamstrup smart meter, all the other meters should follow the same standard (see the NVE note).

There are two data blocks. One is sent every 10 seconds, one every hour.

Following data are pushed from the meter:

Nr|OBIS code|Object|Descrtiption|Unit|Scaler
--|---------|------|------------|----|------

11|1.1.32.7.0.255|UL1|Phase or line voltage 1|V|0
12|1.1.52.7.0.255|UL2|Phase or line voltage 2|V|0
13|1.1.72.7.0.255|UL3|Phase or line voltage 3|V|0
14|0.1.1.0.0.255|RTC|Clock and date
15|1.1.1.8.0.255|A14|Cumulative hourly active import energy|Wh|1
16|1.1.2.8.0.255|A23|Cumulative hourly active export energy|Wh|1
17|1.1.3.8.0.255|R12|Cumulative hourly reactive import energy|varh|1
18|1.1.4.8.0.255|R34|Cumulative hourly reactive export energy|varh|1

Data 1-13 are pushed every 10 seconds, 1-18 is pushed every hour

Data that are not present (if the meter is only one phase) are omitted. Voltage depends on type of grid connection (3 or 4 wire).

The interesting data start on line 7. Every data line starts with 0906, then the OBIS code and a data block. 

## JSON object

There is one object for every value received from the meter. I have choosen this way rather than sending all the data in one object. This way some data will be sent if there is a transmission error. Also the program may be also used for one-phase meters.

The object is defined as such:
```
data : (string)
value : (float value)
topic : "AMS"              
```
```data``` is a string, it identificates what kind of data is sent
ID|Obis code|Explanation
--|---------|-----------
power|P14|Power (W) consumed from the grid at the moment
powerto|P23|Power (W) delivered to the grid
rpower|Q12|Reactive power (var) consumed from the grid
rpowerto|Q34|Reactive power (var) delivered to the grid
pcons|A14|Cumulative consumed power (Wh)
pdelv|A23|Cumulative delivered power (Wh)
rpcons|R12|Cumulative consumed reactive power (varh)
rpdelv|R34|Cumulative delivered reactive power (varh)
amp1|IL1|Current phase 1 (A)
amp2|IL2|Current phase 2 (A)
amp3|IL3|Current phase 3 (A)
vol1|UL1|Voltage phase/line 1 (V)
vol2|UL2|Voltage phase/line 2 (V)
vol3|UL3|Voltage phase/line 3 (V)

```value``` is a float value

```topic``` is a string value "AMS" that allows node red to sort packets according to which device sent them. Effectively it is possible to use the same port and UDP node to receive data from several different devices.
